Question 40:  
A leading carmaker would like to build a new car-as-a-sensor service by leveraging fully serverless components that are provisioned and managed automatically by AWS. The development team at the carmaker does not want an option that requires the capacity to be manually provisioned, as it does not want to respond manually to changing volumes of sensor data.
Given these constraints, which of the following solutions is the BEST fit to develop this car-as-a-sensor service?

Ingest the sensor data in an Amazon SQS standard queue, which is polled by a Lambda function in batches and the data is written into an auto-scaled DynamoDB table for downstream processing
•	 
Ingest the sensor data in a Kinesis Data Stream, which is polled by an application running on an EC2 instance and the data is written into an auto-scaled DynamoDB table for downstream processing
•	 
Ingest the sensor data in an Amazon SQS standard queue, which is polled by an application running on an EC2 instance and the data is written into an auto-scaled DynamoDB table for downstream processing
•

Question 41:  
The engineering team at a Spanish professional football club has built a notification system for its website using Amazon SNS notifications which are then handled by a Lambda function for end-user delivery. During the off-season, the notification systems need to handle about 100 requests per second. During the peak football season, the rate touches about 5000 requests per second and it is noticed that a significant number of the notifications are not being delivered to the end-users on the website.
As a solutions architect, which of the following would you suggest as the BEST possible solution to this issue?
•	 
Amazon SNS message deliveries to AWS Lambda have crossed the account concurrency quota for Lambda, so the team needs to contact AWS support to raise the account limit
•	 
The engineering team needs to provision more servers running the SNS service
•	 
The engineering team needs to provision more servers running the Lambda service
•	 
Amazon SNS has hit a scalability limit, so the team needs to contact AWS support to raise the account limit
Question 42:  
An audit department generates and accesses the audit reports only twice in a financial year.

As a solutions architect, which is the MOST cost-effective storage class that you would recommend to be used for this use-case?
•	 
Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
•	 
Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier)

Which of the following is the MOST resource efficient and cost-optimal way of addressing this issue?
•	 
Change the application architecture to use EFS instead of Amazon S3 for storing the customers' uploaded files
•	 
Change the application architecture to create customer-specific custom prefixes within the single bucket and then upload the daily files into those prefixed locations
•	 
Change the application architecture to create a new S3 bucket for each day's data and then upload the daily files directly under that day's bucket
•	 
Change the application architecture to create a new S3 bucket for each customer and then upload each customer's files directly under the respective buckets
Question 44:

Both ECS with EC2 launch type and ECS with Fargate launch type are charged based on EC2 instances and EBS volumes used
Question 46:  
A social gaming startup has its flagship application hosted on a fleet of EC2 servers running behind an Elastic Load Balancer. These servers are part of an Auto Scaling Group. 90% of the users start logging into the system at 6 pm every day and continue till midnight.

Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a step scaling policy. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm
•	 
Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a scheduled action that kicks-off before 6 pm. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm
•	 
Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a target tracking policy. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm
