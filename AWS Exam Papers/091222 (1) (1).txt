Question 39:  
A developer has configured inbound traffic for the relevant ports in both the Security Group of the EC2 instance as well as the Network Access Control List (NACL) of the subnet for the EC2 instance. The developer is, however, unable to connect to the service running on the Amazon EC2 instance.
As a solutions architect, how will you fix this issue?
•	 
Security Groups are stateful, so allowing inbound traffic to the necessary ports enables the connection. Network ACLs are stateless, so you must allow both inbound and outbound traffic
                                  
•	 
Rules associated with Network ACLs should never be modified from command line. An attempt to modify rules from command line blocks the rule and results in an erratic behavior
•	 
Network ACLs are stateful, so allowing inbound traffic to the necessary ports enables the connection. Security Groups are stateless, so you must allow both inbound and outbound traffic
•	 
IAM Role defined in the Security Group is different from the IAM Role that is given access in the Network ACLs

Question 54:  
A retail company has a fleet of EC2 instances running behind an Auto Scaling group (ASG). The development team has configured two metrics that control the scale-in and scale-out policies of ASG. First one is a target tracking policy that uses a custom metric to add and remove two new instances, based on the number of SQS messages in the queue. The other is a step scaling policy that uses the CloudWatch CPUUtilization metric to launch one new instance when the existing instance exceeds 90 percent utilization for a specified length of time.
While testing, the scale-out policy criteria for both policies was met at the same time. How many new instances will be launched because of these multiple scaling policies?
•	 
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling chooses the policy that provides the largest capacity, so policy with the custom metric is triggered, and two new instances will be launched by the ASG
                                  
•	 
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling chooses the minimum capacity from each of the policies that meet the criteria. So, one new instance will be launched by the ASG
•	 
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling chooses the latest policy after running the algorithm defined during ASG configuration. Based on this output, either of the policies will be chosen for scaling out
•	 
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling chooses the sum of the capacity of all the policies that meet the criteria. So, three new instances will be launched by the ASG
